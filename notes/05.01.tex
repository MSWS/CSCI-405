\begin{itemize}
    \item There are many problems involving a set of tasks in which some tasks
    must be done before others.
    \item For example, consider taking a course only after taking its prerequisites.
\end{itemize}

\begin{description}
    \item[Input] A directed acyclic graph \(G = (V, E)\)
    \item[Output] A linear ordering of the vertices such that for every edge
    \((u, v) \in E\), \(u\) comes before \(v\).
\end{description}

(\textbf{T}/F) A DAG must contain a vertex whose in-degree is 0.
